Hi Admin!

A user named <%= @user.name %> has requested for the cabpool having ID: <%= @cabpool %>. Please check the application for more information.


Hi <%= @user.name %>,

<%= @user.name %> (<%= @user.email %>) has requested for a
  cabpool having ID: <%= @cabpool %>.

<%= @user.name %> lives at:
<%= @user.address %>

If you approve, <%= @user.name %> will be added to your carpool, and a confirmation email will
  be sent to both <%= @user.name %>.

What would you like to do?

<%= add_user_to_cabpool_url(user: @user.id, cabpool: @cabpool, approve: true) %>

<%= add_user_to_cabpool_url(user: @user.id, cabpool: @cabpool, approve: false) %>

Thanks!
Danglay
