Hi <%= @user.name %>

<%= @current_user.name %> (<%= @current_user.email %>) has requested to join your carpool.

<%= @current_user.name %> lives at: <%= @current_user.address %>

If you approve, <%= @current_user.name %> will be added to your carpool, and a confirmation
email will be sent to both <%= @current_user.name %> and to the admin folks who manage your carpool.

What would you like to do?

<%= approve_reject_handler_url(token: @digest, user: @current_user.id, cabpool: @cabpool, approver: @user.id, approve: true) %>

<%= approve_reject_handler_url(token: @digest, user: @current_user.id, cabpool: @cabpool, approver: @user.id, approve: false) %>

Thanks!

Danglay
