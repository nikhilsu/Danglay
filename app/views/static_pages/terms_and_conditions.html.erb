Also, as an added safety, DANGLAY users have a choice of limiting/selecting the organizations in their personal network. Ride users need verify the identity of all the people involved in their ride share, and DANGLAY is not responsible for any failure/problem during and after this validation. Users are not permitted to use/share/monetize any data available on the portal for anything outside the defined functioning of the site. Any damage occurring due to misuse of data will not be entertained/replied/justified by DANGLAY. In such occurrences, DANGLAY is not involved in any of the legal or any other disputes arising. Also, in such cases, DANGLAY has all rights to terminate the involved users from the portal, and if required pursue legal methods.
